AboutAbout
An insatiable desire to learn has guided me down a multidisciplinary journey spanning the fields of business, psychology and neuropharmacology. I have a passion for automating processes and finding creative solutions to complex problems. I am a geek for data analysis and find great fulfillment in gaining theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that drive human behavior across a wide range of domains; from molecular interactions, to interpersonal psychology, to macroeconomic systems and beyond.An insatiable desire to learn has guided me down a multidisciplinary journey spanning the fields of business, psychology and neuropharmacology.

Was employed for 2 years in the lab of Dr. Christopher McCurdy, which specializes in pre-clinical drug development of novel treatments for pain and drug abuse. I worked as part of a highly interdisciplinary research team, enabling me to learn about all aspects of the drug development pipeline, from medicinal chemistry to in-vivo and in-vitro pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. My main responsibilities included culturing Mammalian cell lines, preparing membrane isolations, conducting radioligand binding assays and developing in-vitro functional assays.Was employed for 2 years in the lab of Dr. Christopher McCurdy, which specializes in pre-clinical drug development of novel treatments for pain and drug abuse.

For a number of years I did voluntary work for the OPEN Foundation, which strives to advance scientific research on psychedelics by organizing academic events such as conferences and journal clubs. In addition to organizing ICPR2020, my position as newstracker for OPEN entailed that I scoped through novel research publications, assessed them for relevance to our cause, and added them to OPEN's website database.For a number of years I did voluntary work for the OPEN Foundation, which strives to advance scientific research on psychedelics by organizing academic events such as conferences and journal clubs.

During my BSc, my psychological interests were supplemented with a newly found passion for science on psychoactive substances. Ergo, I moved to Ireland to pursue a MSc degree in neuropharmacology, which helped to broaden my theoretical knowledge of psychiatric neuroscience and it gave me a decent amount of wet lab experience.During my BSc, my psychological interests were supplemented with a newly found passion for science on psychoactive substances.
